The concept evolved from a general 2D block-building game to a focused, responsive, cross-device experience using Phaser.js. Early discussions weighed complexity (e.g., day/night cycles, pathfinding) against the need for a fun, easy-to-play game. The design journey included debates about control schemes, building mechanics, and the choice between 2D and simulated 3D, ultimately favoring a top-down, grid-based approach for ease of use and development.\n\n## 🚀 Project Genesis & Motivation\nThe motivation was personal: to create a custom game for a child’s birthday, capturing the excitement of Minecraft in a form approachable for a young beginner. The project was inspired by the child’s fascination with Minecraft and the desire to provide a creative, interactive experience tailored to her age and skills. The goal was to foster creativity, exploration, and fun, while keeping technical and gameplay complexity low.\n\n## 🚀 Project Overview\nAmelcraft is a simple, 2D, tile-based game where players can harvest materials and place blocks in a world reminiscent of Minecraft. Designed for both desktop and mobile, it features responsive controls and adaptive camera zoom, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. The game is intended for young children, with intuitive drag-to-move controls and straightforward block placement.\n\n## 💡 Core Ideas & Features\n- **2D Tile-Based World:** The game world is a grid of 48x48px tiles.\n- **Harvesting & Placing Blocks:** Players collect materials and place blocks on the grid.\n- **Drag-to-Move Controls:** Movement is controlled by dragging on the screen (touch or mouse).\n- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to device size and orientation, with dynamic camera zoom.\n- **Simple Inventory:** Materials collected are stored and can be selected for placement.\n- **Single-File POC:** Initial proof-of-concept provided as a single HTML file for easy testing.\n\n## 🧩 Design Decisions & Rationale\n- **Phaser.js Chosen:** For rapid development and cross-platform support.\n- **Drag-to-Move Over Click-to-Move:** Simpler for young children, avoids pathfinding complexity.\n- **Top-Down (Horizontal) Building:** More intuitive for kids, easier to implement than vertical or 3D.\n- **Responsive Canvas & Camera Zoom:** Ensures playability on all devices, keeps sprites visible and detailed.\n- **No Day/Night Cycle:** Dropped for simplicity.\n- **Block Placement Logic:** Grid-based, with pointer-to-tile conversion for intuitive interaction.\n\n## ❌ Rejected Ideas & Alternatives\n- **Day/Night Cycle:** Rejected to keep the game simple.\n- **Click-to-Move with Pathfinding:** Considered but dropped due to complexity.\n- **3D or Isometric Building:** Rejected for technical and cognitive simplicity; 2D chosen.\n- **Vertical (Wall) Building:** Considered, but horizontal (ground) building selected for accessibility.\n\n## ⚖️ Player vs. Team Focus Debate\nThe game is designed as a single-player experience, focused on individual creativity and exploration. Team or multiplayer features were not prioritized, given the target audience and scope.\n\n## 🌏 Personal/Inspirational Details\nThe project was inspired by a child’s birthday and her fascination with Minecraft. The design choices reflect a desire to create a fun, approachable experience tailored to her interests and abilities.\n\n## 💬 Key Conversation Excerpts\n> “For my daughter's 7th birthday I want to make her a little video game, using phaser.js...simple 2D, sprite and tilemap based game, in which she can harvest a few materials and then place blocks from these materials in the world.”\n\n> “I want the game to run on a desktop, as well as a mobile phone...controllable by touch/mouse click and the game screen and camera zoom level should adapt itself to the device.”\n\n> “For simplicity and a smooth experience for a 7-year-old, Option 2 (drag-to-move) is best. It’s easy to implement in Phaser, and kids enjoy direct control.”\n\n> “For a Minecraft-like experience and simplicity for a child, the horizontal plane (top-down) is best. It’s intuitive, easy to control, and lets your daughter ‘walk’ over her creations.”\n\n## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure\n- **Phaser.js Engine:** Handles rendering, input, and game logic.\n- **Responsive Canvas:** Uses Phaser’s scale manager for device adaptation.\n- **Camera Zoom Logic:** Dynamically calculates zoom based on screen size and tile size.\n- **Player Sprite:** Controlled via drag-to-move pointer events.\n- **Tile Grid:** 2D array represents the world; block placement updates the grid and renders sprites.\n- **Inventory System:** Simple array for collected materials and block selection.\n\n## 💻 Code Snippets & Examples\n\n### Responsive Game Screen & Zoom\n\n\u003CCode\n  src={{ \"vanilla-ts\": {\n    'index.html': new URL('file:///docs/responsive-game-screen/index.html'),\n    'index.ts': new URL('file:///docs/responsive-game-screen/index.ts')\n  }}}\n/>\n\n### Movement and Block Placement\n\n\u003CCode\n  src={{ \"vanilla-ts\": {\n    'index.html': new URL('file:///docs/movement-and-block-placement/index.html'),\n    'index.ts': new URL('file:///docs/movement-and-block-placement/index.ts')\n  }}}\n/>\n\n### Drag to Move\n\n\u003CCode\n  src={{ \"vanilla-ts\": {\n    'index.html': new URL('file:///docs/drag-to-move/index.html'),\n    'index.ts': new URL('file:///docs/drag-to-move/index.ts')\n  }}}\n/>\n\n### Block Placement\n\n\u003CCode\n  src={{ \"vanilla-ts\": {\n    'index.html': new URL('file:///docs/block-placement/index.html'),\n    'index.ts': new URL('file:///docs/block-placement/index.ts')\n  }}}\n/>\n\n## 📚 References & Inspirations\n- [Phaser.js Documentation](https://phaser.io/)\n- Minecraft (as inspiration for block-building mechanics)\n- Stardew Valley, Zelda (for top-down design ideas)\n\n## ❓ Open Questions & Next Steps\n- Expand inventory and block types.\n- Add harvesting mechanics and sound effects.\n- Design custom sprites and tiles.\n- Consider simple NPCs or animals for added fun.\n- Polish UI for block selection and inventory management.","../../docs/CONCEPT.mdx","59941ab0d13bcd01",true,"architecture",{"id":18,"data":20,"body":21,"filePath":22,"digest":23,"rendered":24},{},"# Architecture\n\nThis document explores multiple architectural styles for game development, as discussed in the context of a Phaser.js project. We provide an overview of each, sample implementations based on a simple tile-based game (with animation and hit detection), and a critical evaluation of their benefits and drawbacks.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

Model-View-Controller (MVC): Sample & Evaluation\n7. Event-Driven / Observer Pattern: Sample & Evaluation\n8. Related Documents\n\n## Decision\n\nFor Amelcraft, we will begin with the Japanese Software Philosophy (minimalist, in-scene model) to maximize simplicity, rapid prototyping, and maintainability. This approach is ideal for small, fast-evolving games and allows for quick iteration and easy refactoring.\n\nIf the game grows in complexity—such as adding more entities, advanced mechanics, or requiring better testability and scalability—we will incrementally refactor toward an Entity-Component-System (ECS) or Hexagonal architecture. These styles offer greater modularity, decoupling, and long-term maintainability, but introduce more boilerplate and abstraction.\n\nThis staged approach ensures we keep development efficient and accessible in the early phases, while remaining flexible to adopt more robust architectural patterns as needed.\n\n## Alternatives\n\n| Style                        | Core Focus / Principle              | Strengths                                              | Drawbacks / When to Avoid                |\n| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| Japanese Software Philosophy | Simplicity, clarity, Kaizen         | Minimal, readable, easy to refactor, fast to prototype | Can get messy as complexity grows        |\n| Hexagonal Architecture       | Separation of concerns, testability | Decoupled, testable, flexible, scalable                | Boilerplate, overkill for small games    |\n| ECS                          | Composition over inheritance        | Highly flexible, reusable, efficient for many objects  | Verbose, harder to debug, overkill small |\n| MVC                          | UI/data/input separation            | Clear roles, easy to test UI/logic separately          | Verbose, not always natural for games    |\n| Event-Driven / Observer      | Decoupled event notification        | Flexible, extensible, easy to add features             | Can be hard to trace/debug, memory leaks |\n\n**Summary:**\n- For small, rapidly evolving games, Japanese style or MVC can be ideal.\n- For large, complex, or long-lived games, Hexagonal or ECS offer better scalability and maintainability.\n- Event-driven/Observer is best for decoupling and extensibility, but can add complexity if overused.\n\n## Japanese Software Philosophy: Sample & Evaluation\n\n- **Focus:** Code as craftsmanship, simplicity, clarity, and continuous small improvements (Kaizen).\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Highly maintainable and readable code.\n  - Minimal ceremony and abstraction; only extract when needed.\n  - Emphasizes bug prevention and immediate fixes.\n  - Evolves codebase gradually, avoiding speculative design.\n- **What it solves:**\n  - Reduces over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.\n  - Keeps codebase approachable and easy to refactor.\n\n### Sample Implementation (Minimalist, In-Scene Model)\n\n```ts\nimport Phaser from \"phaser\";\n\nexport class MainScene extends Phaser.Scene {\n  private player!:

Critical Evaluation\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Extremely clear and easy to follow; all logic is in one place.\n  - No unnecessary abstractions or indirection.\n  - Easy to refactor as requirements change.\n  - Fast to prototype and iterate.\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - As the game grows (e.g., more input types, more entities, inventory, tile placement), the scene can become bloated and harder to maintain.\n  - Harder to test logic in isolation (e.g., movement, collision) without running the full game.\n  - Tightly coupled to Phaser; porting to another engine or platform would require significant rewrites.\n\n---\n\n## Entity-Component-System (ECS): Sample & Evaluation\n\n- **Focus:** Composition over inheritance; entities are composed of reusable components, and systems operate on entities with specific components.\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Highly flexible and extensible; new behaviors are added by composing components.\n  - Efficient for games with many similar objects (e.g., tile-based, simulation, or action games).\n  - Decouples data (components) from behavior (systems).\n- **What it solves:**\n  - Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies and promotes code reuse.\n  - Makes it easy to add, remove, or modify behaviors at runtime.\n\n\n### Sample Implementation (Complete ECS Example)\n\n```ts\n// --- ECS Core Types ---\ntype Entity = number;\ninterface Component

input, domain logic, and animation/presentation are modular and testable.\n  - Animation selection is decoupled from input, following best practices.\n  - Easy to extend (e.g., add AI, new input types, or swap out rendering engine).\n  - Domain logic is decoupled from Phaser, making porting and testing easier.\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - More boilerplate and indirection, especially for small/simple games.\n  - Can feel over-engineered if the game remains simple.\n  - Slightly slower to prototype and iterate due to extra layers.\n\n---\n\n## Model-View-Controller (MVC): Sample & Evaluation\n\n- **Focus:** Separates application logic (model), user interface (view), and input handling (controller).\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Clear separation of concerns; UI and logic can evolve independently.\n  - Multiple views can represent the same model.\n  - Well-suited for UI-heavy or tool-driven games.\n- **What it solves:**\n  - Keeps UI code and business/game logic separate.\n  - Makes it easier to test and maintain code.\n\n### Sample Implementation (MVC)\n\n```ts\n// --- Model ---\nclass PlayerModel {\n  x = 100;\n  y = 100;\n  dx = 0;\n  dy = 0;\n  move(dx: number, dy: number) {\n    this.dx = dx;\n    this.dy = dy;\n    this.x += dx;\n    this.y += dy;\n  }\n}\n\n// --- View ---\nclass PlayerView {\n  constructor(private sprite: Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite) {}\n  render(x: number, y: number, dx: number, dy: number) {\n    this.sprite.setPosition(x, y);\n    if (dx \u003C 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-left', true);\n    else if (dx > 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-right', true);\n    else if (dy \u003C 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-up', true);\n    else if (dy > 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-down', true);\n    else this.sprite.setVelocity(0, 0);\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Controller ---\nclass PlayerController {\n  constructor(private model: PlayerModel, private view: PlayerView, private cursors: Phaser.Types.Input.Keyboard.CursorKeys) {}\n  update() {\n    const speed = 100;\n    let dx = 0, dy = 0;\n    if (this.cursors.left?.isDown) dx = -speed;\n    else if (this.cursors.right?.isDown) dx = speed;\n    if (this.cursors.up?.isDown) dy = -speed;\n    else if (this.cursors.down?.isDown) dy = speed;\n    this.model.move(dx, dy);\n    this.view.render(this.model.x, this.model.y, dx, dy);\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Phaser Scene Integration ---\nimport Phaser from 'phaser';\n\nexport class MainScene extends Phaser.Scene {\n  private playerModel!: PlayerModel;\n  private playerView!: PlayerView;\n  private playerController!: PlayerController;\n  private cursors!: Phaser.Types.Input.Keyboard.CursorKeys;\n  private obstacles!: Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticGroup;\n\n  preload() {\n    this.load.spritesheet('player', 'player.png', { frameWidth: 32, frameHeight: 48 });\n    this.load.image('rock', 'rock.png');\n  }\n\n  create() {\n    // Player sprite with physics\n    const playerSprite = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 100, 'player');\n    playerSprite.setCollideWorldBounds(true);\n\n    // Define player walking animations\n    this.anims.create({ key: 'walk-left', frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('player', { start: 9, end: 11 }), frameRate: 10, repeat: -1 });\n    this.anims.create({ key: 'walk-right', frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('player', { start: 6, end: 8 }), frameRate: 10, repeat: -1 });\n    this.anims.create({ key: 'walk-up', frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('player', { start: 3, end: 5 }), frameRate: 10, repeat: -1 });\n    this.anims.create({ key: 'walk-down', frames: this.anims.generateFrameNumbers('player', { start: 0, end: 2 }), frameRate: 10, repeat: -1 });\n\n    // Input\n    this.cursors = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys();\n\n    // Add obstacles (e.g., rocks)\n    this.obstacles = this.physics.add.staticGroup();\n    this.obstacles.create(200, 100, 'rock');\n

this.playerController.update();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Critical Evaluation\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Clear separation of data, presentation, and input logic.\n  - Easy to swap out or test views and controllers independently.\n  - Well-suited for games/tools with complex UI or multiple representations of state.\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Can be verbose for simple games.\n  - May require extra glue code to synchronize model and view.\n  - Not always a natural fit for real-time, highly interactive games.\n\n---\n\n## Event-Driven / Observer Pattern: Sample & Evaluation\n\n- **Focus:** Components communicate by emitting and listening for events; observer pattern enables one-to-many notification of state changes.\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Decouples components; emitters and listeners don’t need to know about each other.\n  - Enables flexible, dynamic interactions and extensibility.\n  - Well-suited for UI, input, and game state changes.\n- **What it solves:**\n  - Reduces tight coupling between systems.\n  - Makes it easy to add new reactions to events without modifying existing code.\n\n### Sample Implementation (Observer/Event-Driven)\n\n```ts\n// --- Subject (Observable) ---\nclass Player {\n  private observers: ((event: string, data?: any) => void)[] = [];\n  x = 100;\n  y = 100;\n  dx = 0;\n  dy = 0;\n  move(dx: number, dy: number) {\n    this.dx = dx;\n    this.dy = dy;\n    this.x += dx;\n    this.y += dy;\n    this.notify('move', { x: this.x, y: this.y, dx, dy });\n  }\n  on(event: string, callback: (event: string, data?: any) => void) {\n    this.observers.push(callback);\n  }\n  notify(event: string, data?: any) {\n    for (const cb of this.observers) cb(event, data);\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Observer (View) ---\nclass PlayerView {\n  constructor(private sprite: Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite, player: Player) {\n    player.on('move', (_, data) => {\n      this.sprite.setPosition(data.x, data.y);\n      // Animation based on direction\n      if (data.dx \u003C 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-left', true);\n      else if (data.dx > 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-right', true);\n      else if (data.dy \u003C 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-up', true);\n      else if (data.dy > 0) this.sprite.anims.play('walk-down', true);\n      else this.sprite.setVelocity(0, 0);\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n// --- Controller ---\nclass PlayerController {\n  constructor(private

modifying core logic.\n  - Well-suited for UI, input, and game state changes.\n- **Drawbacks:**\n  - Can lead to hard-to-trace event chains and debugging challenges.\n  - Risk of memory leaks if observers are not properly removed.\n  - Overuse can make codebase harder to reason about.\n\n---\n\n## Related Documents\n\nThese companion documents dive deeper into specific subsystems referenced

\"Moving\" mode via the HUD.\n- While in Moving mode, pressing and holding the mouse button or touch pointer causes the PC to walk toward the pointer, following it as long as it is pressed.\n- If the player moves the mouse/pointer while it's being pressed, the PC will change its course and walk towards the new destination\n- The PC cannot walk onto invalid terrain:\n  - Water Blocks\n- No tile highlighting occurs in this mode.\n- The camera follows the PC, maintaining visibility and recentering if the PC nears the edge.\n- Zooming is available via scroll wheel (mouse) or pinch (touch), always centering on the PC.\n\n## Inventory\n\n- The player has an inventory with all collected Blocks and their count\n\n## Block Collection\n\n- The player can select \"Collecting\" mode via the HUD (Pickaxe icon).\n- In Collecting mode, hovering or pressing down on a block highlights it.\n- There is no distance limitation for starting collection; the PC will walk to the block if not adjacent.\n- The PC always turns to face the selected block before collecting.\n- The collecting process uses a 2-second progress bar; if interrupted, the process is canceled.\n- Collection follows inventory rules: blocks are added if space is available, and replaced in the world according to block type rules:\n  - Water:\n    - Water can be collected, increasing its count in the inventory, but the Water block is never removed from the world when collected.\n  - Ground:\n    - When Ground is collected, a Water block appears in its place.\n  - Grass:\n    - Grass always sits on top of Ground.\n    - When Grass is collected, a Ground block appears in its place.\n  - Snow:\n    - Snow always sits on top of Ground.\n    - When Snow is collected, a Ground block appears in its place.\n  - Sand:\n    - When Sand is collected, a Water block appears in its place.\n  - All Other Blocks:\n    - All other blocks, when collected, are replaced by Water Blocks.\n\n## Block Placement\n\n- The player can select \"Placing\" mode via the HUD dropdown (block selection).\n- In Placing mode, hovering a tile highlights it.\n- There is no distance limitation for placing; the PC will walk to the tile if not adjacent.\n- The PC always turns to face the selected tile before placing the block.\n- Placement is only possible if the player has at least one of the selected block type in inventory.\n- Placement decreases the inventory count for the placed block by 1.\n\n## HUD\n\n- The HUD is placed at the bottom center of the view\n- It contains 3 toggleable Buttons: Moving, Block Placement, Block Collection\n- Moving:\n  - When toggled, the Moving mode is activated\n  - Has a fitting monochrome Icon\n- Block Placement:\n  - Will show the Block Inventory, when toggled and set the Block Placement mode active\n  - The Inventory shows every Block in the inventory with count > 0 and their current count in a Badge\n  - The count will immdiately updated, when the inventory updates\n  - The selected Block is used as the Graphic for the Block Placement toggle Button\n- Block Collection:\n  - When toggled, the Block Collecting mode is activated\n  - Has a monchrome pickaxe

This document defines the initial crafting feature focused on converting base sand (Yellow) plus a single flower into colored sand blocks. Keeps HUD minimal by using a modal opened from a dedicated HudOption.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Goals\n\n1. Enable players to transform Yellow sand blocks into colored sand variants using flowers.\n2. Maintain a minimal HUD: crafting interaction lives inside a modal invoked by a single HudOption icon.\n3. Guarantee atomic crafting transactions (all inputs consumed only if outputs can be fully added to inventory).\n4. Provide deterministic distribution for mixed output recipes (red flower 50/50 split) for predictable player experience.\n5. Avoid clutter: flowers remain a hidden resource except aggregate count badge and crafting modal.\n\nNon-goals (first iteration): batch multi-flower recipes, partial output on inventory overflow, asynchronous crafting timers, animation/sound polish, recipe discovery mechanics.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Terminology\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| Flower | A collected object (ObjectId) with id starting `flower_`. Consumed as catalyst. |\n| Sand (Base) | The Yellow block (`assets.blocks.sprites.Yellow`) used as input. |\n| Colored Sand | Output blocks (Red, LightRed, LightCyan, Cyan (Turquoise fallback), Blue, Magenta, LightMagenta). |\n| Crafting Transaction | Single action consuming 1 flower + N base sand (1..10) producing N colored sand blocks. |\n| Recipe | Mapping flower id -> output distribution rule. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Input / Output Contract\n\nContract (single craft operation):\n- Inputs: exactly 1 flower object + `n` Yellow sand blocks where `1 \u003C= n \u003C= 10` and inventory holds at least `n` Yellow.\n- Output count: exactly `n` blocks (one-for-one conversion, no multiplier).\n- Output kind distribution per flower:\n  - `flower_red` -> 50% Red, 50% LightRed (odd counts: extra goes to Red first)  \n  - `flower_cyan` -> 100% LightCyan  \n  - `flower_turquoise` -> 100% Cyan  \n  - `flower_blue` -> 100% Blue  \n  - `flower_purple` -> 100% Magenta  \n  - `flower_pink` -> 100% LightMagenta  \n\nFailure Modes:\n- No eligible flower selected → UI disables craft button.\n- Sand amount zero → UI disables craft button.\n- Insufficient Yellow sand → UI disables craft button.\n- Inventory does not have space for all output stacks → transaction aborted, show error.\n\nAtomicity: On success remove 1 flower + `n` Yellow, then add output blocks. If any addition fails mid-way, rollback (re-add removed inputs) and present failure message.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Recipes Data Structure\n\n```ts\ninterface CraftRecipe {\n  id: ObjectId;                 // flower id\n  distribute(n: number): { block: Block; count: number }[]; // deterministic\n  description: string;          // shown in modal\n}\n```\n\nImplementation details:\n- Use a recipe map keyed by flower id.\n- For mixed distribution (red) implement integer split: `Math.floor(n/2)` LightRed, remainder Red.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Inventory API Additions\n\nNew methods required:\n```ts\nremoveBlock(block: Block, count: number): boolean;      // all-or-nothing\nremoveObject(id: ObjectId, count?: number): boolean;     // default count=1\naddMany(block: Block, count: number): boolean;          // treat stacks; returns false if cannot add all\n```\nRollback helper could snapshot affected slots or perform inverse operations immediately if failure occurs during output addition.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Crafting Module (`Crafting.ts`)\n\nResponsibilities:\n- Validation (`validateCraft(flowerId, sandCount, inventory)`)\n- Simulation (`simulate(flowerId, sandCount)` returns distribution for preview)\n- Execution (`executeCraft(flowerId, sandCount, inventory)` returns result object `{ ok, outputs, error? }`)\n\nPseudo-code:\n```ts\nfunction executeCraft(flowerId: ObjectId, n: number, inv: Inventory): CraftResult {\n  const recipe = RECIPES[flowerId];\n  if (!recipe) return { ok: false, error: 'Unknown recipe' };\n  if (n \u003C 1 || n > 10) return { ok: false, error: 'Invalid sand amount' };\n  if (!inv.has(Yellow) || inv.count(Yellow) \u003C n) return { ok: false, error: 'Not enough sand' };\n  if (!inv.hasObject(flowerId)) return { ok: false, error: 'Flower missing' };\n  const outputs = recipe.distribute(n);\n  // Check capacity\n  if (!canAddAll(inv, outputs)) return { ok: false, error: 'Inventory full' };\n  // Apply (atomic)\n  inv.removeObject(flowerId);\n  inv.removeBlock(Yellow, n);\n  if (!addAll(inv, outputs)) {\n    // rollback\n    inv.addObject(flowerId);\n    inv.addMany(Yellow, n);\n    return { ok: false, error: 'Inventory overflow during add' };\n  }\n  return { ok: true, outputs };\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. HUD & Modal Integration\n\nHUD Changes:\n- Add new HudOption (\"craft\") with beaker icon ⚗️.\n- Clicking it toggles `\u003Ccraft-modal>` (overlay panel centered).\n\nModal `\u003Ccraft-modal>`:\n- Flower selection (sprite icons with counts; click to select a flower catalyst).\n- Sand amount selector (range 1..10 clamped by available Yellow count).\n- Live preview of output distribution (colored block icons + counts).\n- Craft button (HudOption styling) disabled until valid; shows reason in `title` attribute.\n- Close controls: ESC key, backdrop click, or success.\n\nMinimalism: Modal only appears when actively crafting; HUD itself adds exactly one icon. No persistent extra panels.\n\n---\n\n## 8. UI States & Feedback\n\nStates:\n1. Empty (no flowers) → message \"No flowers collected\"; craft disabled.\n2. Insufficient sand → display current vs required.\n3. Overflow risk → message advising freeing inventory space.\n4. Success → transient confirmation (e.g. fade-out toast) then modal auto-closes.\n\nAccessibility Considerations: Use semantic buttons, focus first interactive element, ESC to close, ARIA role `dialog` with `aria-modal=\"true\"`.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Testing Strategy\n\nUnit Tests (Vitest):\n- Red recipe splitting even/odd counts.\n- Each 100% recipe outputs correct block id and count.\n- Blocked yellow flower returns error; inventory unaffected.\n- Insufficient sand count error.\n- Inventory space failure triggers rollback (flower + sand unchanged).\n- Maximum sand (10) success path.\n\nIntegration-esque:\n- Simulate inventory with multiple flowers & sand; execute craft; ensure HUD update call expected.\n\nEdge Cases:\n- Sand count exactly matches remaining stack capacity for output blocks.\n- Inventory nearly full (adding outputs require new slot vs merge).\n\n---\n\n## 10. Performance & Limits\n\n- Max sand per craft: 10 (tiny scope → negligible performance impact).\n- Distribution function O(1) per output kind (worst-case 2 entries for red split).\n- Modal instantiation on demand; no persistent interval updates.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Future Enhancements\n\n| Idea | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| DarkCyan Asset | Add new block sprite enabling distinct turquoise output. |\n| Multi-Flower Boost | More flowers => multiplier (e.g., 1 flower + 10 sand → 12 colored). |\n| Discovery System | Unlock recipes on first flower collection. |\n| Craft Queue | Batch multiple crafts before closing modal. |\n| Particle Effects | Sand tinting animation during craft. |\n| Sound Feedback | Success / failure audio cues. |\n\n---\n\n## 12. Open Questions\n\n1. Should sand amount 0 be allowed for preview only? (Currently disallow.)\n2. Rollback strategy acceptable or should we pre-check slot capacity more deeply to avoid partial add attempts?\n\n---\n\n## 13. Implementation Checklist\n\n```\n1. [x] Extend Inventory (removeBlock, removeObject, addMany, hasObject, count helpers)\n2. [x] Add 'craft' to Option union & HUD icon\n3. [x] Create Crafting.ts (recipes, simulate, execute)\n4. [x] Implement \u003Ccraft-modal> custom element\n5. [x] Integrate HUD option toggling modal\n6. [x] Wire CraftResult HUD refresh workflow\n7. [x] Add unit tests for crafting logic\n8. [x] Update COLLECTIBLES.md (link to crafting doc) or cross-reference\n9. [ ] Optional: toast feedback on success/failure\n```\n\n---\n\n## 14. Quick Reference\n\n| Concern | Location |\n|---------|----------|\n| Recipes Map | `Crafting.ts` RECIPES constant |\n| Yellow block id | `assets.blocks.sprites.Yellow` |\n| Flower ids | `assets.objects.sprites.*` with `flower_` prefix |\n| Modal element | `\u003Ccraft-modal>` (shadow DOM recommended) |\n| Execution entry | `executeCraft()` |\n\n---\n\nEnd of design.","../../docs/CRAFTING.md","66b38d66aa912b3a",{"html":272,"metadata":273},"\u003Ch2 id=\"colored-sand-crafting-system\">Colored Sand Crafting System\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"status\">Status\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Design Phase – Implementation pending (inventory removal helpers, crafting module, HUD modal, tests).

This update adds cross-references to the colored sand crafting system. Remaining: Step 14 (manual QA & tuning), future crafting & enhancements.\n\nQuick Links: [Colored Sand Crafting System](./CRAFTING.md) – see design & recipes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Goals\n\n1. Procedurally distribute flower objects on grass-biome islands (per chunk).\n2. Player collection prioritizes an object (flower) over ground tile mutation when present.\n3. Collected flower:\n   - Added to inventory (stacking logic similar to blocks, but as a distinct item kind).\n   - Removed visually and from world state.\n4. Flower presence / absence persists (survives reload) just like mutated tiles.\n5. Keep architecture forward-compatible for additional object types (rocks) and richer metadata (durability, growth, etc.).\n\nNon-goals (for this first pass): regrowth, tool requirements, animation, deterministic baseline diff compression (we store full object list initially), multi-layer pathfinding interactions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Terminology\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| Tile | Terrain base (numeric ID sourced from `assets.blocks.sprites`). |\n| Object | A collectible entity placed \"on\" a tile (flower, rock). Not encoded as tile ID. |\n| Chunk | 100×100 tile region (see `CHUNK_TILES`). Owns tiles + objects. |\n| Overlay Diff | Sparse tile mutations relative to baseline. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Data Model Additions\n\n```ts\n// Object identity (matches frame names in objects atlas)\ntype ObjectId =\n  | 'flower_red' | 'flower_cyan'\n  | 'flower_turquoise' | 'flower_blue' | 'flower_purple' | 'flower_pink'\n  // (rocks reserved for later)\n  ;\ninterface WorldObject {\n  id: ObjectId;          // atlas frame key\n  i: number;             // linear tile index (tx + ty * CHUNK_TILES)\n  sprite: Phaser.GameObjects.Image; // runtime only (not serialized)\n}\n\ninterface SerializedObjectEntry {\n  i: number;  // linear tile index\n  k: ObjectId; // kind / frame key\n}\n\ninterface SerializedChunk {\n  ...\n  objects?: SerializedObjectEntry[]; // Optional full snapshot (first implementation)\n}\n\n// Inventory\ntype InventoryItem =\n  | { kind: 'block'; id: Block; count: number }\n  | { kind: 'object'; id: ObjectId; count: number };\n```\n\nRationale: Keep initial persistence simple (complete object list) → easier to reason about, small size (expected dozens max per chunk). Can evolve to diff-of-removals later if a deterministic baseline for objects is introduced.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Procedural Generation (Flowers)\n\nGeneration occurs inside `World.generateIsland()` (or a new helper invoked after tile generation) only if the biome kind is `grass`.\n\nAlgorithm:\n1. Inspect all tiles after base land generation.\n2. For each grass tile (not sand/water), with probability `p = 1 / FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR` attempt placement.\n3. Randomly choose a flower variant with uniform distribution across available frames.\n4. Ensure no duplicate object already at that index.\n5. Store as `WorldObject` (create sprite) and append to internal object map.\n\nConstants (add to `constants.ts` or a new config file):\n```ts\nexport const FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR = 100;  // tuned from 140 (Step 14) to raise average flower count\nexport const OBJECT_DEPTH = 0.5;            // draw order (ground=0, objects=0.5, player=1, highlight=10)\n```\n\nDeterminism: Use the existing per-chunk RNG (`mulberry32(seed)`) so flower placement is predictable. Because we are *persisting* the full object list, determinism is nice but not strictly required for correctness now; it *will* matter if/when we switch to diff-of-removals.\n\n---\n\n## 5. World Integration\n\nAdd to `World`:\n```ts\nprivate objects: Map\u003Cnumber, WorldObject> = new Map();\n\naddObject(id: ObjectId, tx: number, ty: number): void;\ngetObjectAt(tx: number, ty: number): WorldObject | null;\nremoveObjectAt(tx: number, ty: number): boolean; // returns true if removed\n\nserializeObjects(): SerializedObjectEntry[];\napplySerializedObjects(list: SerializedObjectEntry[]): void;\n```\n\nRendering: Each object -> `this.shell.add.image(offsetX + tx*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE/2, offsetY + ty*TILE_SIZE + TILE_SIZE/2, assets.objects.key, id)` with `setDepth(OBJECT_DEPTH)`. Destroy sprite when object removed or chunk destroyed.\n\nPersistence hooks:\n* Include `objects` array inside `serializeDiff` return value.\n* In `WorldManager.loadExisting`, after applying tile diff, if `data.objects` present → call `applySerializedObjects`.\n* Any add/remove triggers `onMutate()` so chunk save scheduling includes object changes.\n\nBackward compatibility: Old saved chunks without `objects` simply load with none (fine). New code must tolerate `objects` missing.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WorldManager Helpers\n\nAdd convenience methods for global coordinates:\n```ts\ngetObjectAtGlobal(tileX: number, tileY: number): WorldObject | null;\nremoveObjectAtGlobal(tileX: number, tileY: number): boolean;\n```\nThese mirror existing tile helpers and translate global tile coordinates to chunk-local indices.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collection Flow Changes\n\nAmend `CollectMode.finishCollection(tx, ty)` logic:\n1. Query `worldManager.getObjectAtGlobal(tx, ty)`.\n2. If found:\n   - Attempt `inventory.addObject(obj.id)`.\n   - If added, `worldManager.removeObjectAtGlobal(tx, ty)` and HUD refresh.\n   - Return early (skip tile mutation logic).\n3. Else run existing tile collection logic (tile transforms + adding block to inventory).\n\nCollection time: unchanged (1s). Possible future variation per object.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Inventory & HUD Adjustments\n\nInventory changes:\n* Internally store entries as `InventoryItem` union (already partially implemented).\n* Expose existing block-centric APIs unchanged for now.\n* Flowers (object items) are collected and stacked but are NOT rendered in the block HUD bar – they remain hidden resources.\n\nHUD decision (updated):\n* Do not add flower icons to the primary block slot strip to avoid clutter.\n* Future interaction: a crafting / combination UI (not yet implemented) will allow combining a flower with sand blocks to produce colored sand variants. This will consume one flower per batch (design TBD) and tint or swap sand block tiles.\n\nBackward compatibility: Since HUD ignores object entries, no immediate visual migration needed. Later, a secondary panel or context menu can expose flower counts when the combination feature is introduced.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Persistence Format Example\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"version\": 1,\n  \"worldSeed\": \"local-seed\",\n  \"chunkX\": 0,\n  \"chunkY\": 0,\n  \"biomeId\": \"grass\",\n  \"diff\": [ { \"i\": 5050, \"t\": 11 } ],\n  \"objects\": [\n    { \"i\": 4321, \"k\": \"flower_red\" },\n    { \"i\": 7890, \"k\": \"flower_blue\" }\n  ],\n  \"lastTouched\": 1730000000000\n}\n```\n\nIf `objects` absent, treat as empty list.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Testing Strategy\n\nUnit / Integration tests (place in `proc/` or new test file):\n1. Generation Density: For a grass biome chunk, count flowers; assert within expected bounds (e.g., 0 \u003C count \u003C CHUNK_TILES*CHUNK_TILES / FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR * 2).\n2. Biome Restriction: Desert / snow biome chunks either produce zero flowers.\n3. Collection: Simulate adding a flower at tile, collect → inventory increments, object removed, tile unchanged.\n4. Persistence: After removal, serialize + reload (apply diff & objects) → ensure flower not present.\n5. Backward Compatibility: Loading a serialized chunk without `objects` does not throw.\n\nEdge cases (manual QA):\n* Collect while moving across chunk boundary.\n* Collecting multiple flowers quickly (inventory stacking works, no duplicates remain in world).\n* Saving & reloading with mixed tile mutations and object removals.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Performance Considerations\n\n* Expected flower count per chunk is small (\u003C ~80 @ current density). Full list serialization negligible.\n* Object lookups use a `Map\u003Cnumber,WorldObject>` O(1).\n* Save size overhead: each object entry ~ (index + small string) – acceptable; could compress later.\n* Future optimization: store baseline deterministic placement and only track removals to reduce I/O.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Future Enhancements (Not in First Pass)\n\n* Rocks with longer collection times or tool gating.\n* Object-specific animations / particle effects on collection.\n* Regrowth timers or seasonal generation refresh.\n* Deterministic baseline + diff-of-removals for compact saves.\n* Object metadata (durability, growth s\n* tage) via `SerializedTileMetaEntry` or a parallel `objectsMeta` extension.\n* Pathfinding collision if certain objects become blocking.\n\n---\n\n## 13.

[x] Documentation updates (this file – keep in sync if design shifts)\n14. [ ] Manual QA & tuning (flower density, visual overlap)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 14. Risks & Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Inventory / HUD break due to new union type | Introduce adapters; keep old code paths until fully migrated. |\n| Save incompatibility | Optional `objects` field guarded by presence checks. |\n| Visual clutter / performance with too many objects | Density constant tweak; future culling if needed. |\n| Hidden resource confusion (flowers not visible in HUD) | Add future crafting/combo panel listing flower counts. |\n| Future diff optimization complexity | Keep simple full snapshot now; encapsulate serialization for easy swap later. |\n\n---\n\n## 15. Quick Reference (Dev Cheatsheet)\n\n| Concern | Location / Action |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| Add new object kind | Append frame to objects atlas + extend `ObjectId` union. |\n| Force re-gen (dev) | Clear IndexedDB chunk keys or change world seed. |\n| Adjust density | `FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR` constant. |\n| Rendering order | `OBJECT_DEPTH` constant (objects 0.5 \u003C player 1). |\n\n---\n\n## 16. Open Questions (Track & Resolve Before Expanding to Rocks)\n\n1. Should flower collection have its own animation or sound cue? (Placeholder now.)\n2. Should we prevent flower placement on edge sand tiles of grass biome? (Currently yes— only on grass.)\n3. Should inventory differentiate categories visually? (Deferred.)\n\n---\n\nEnd of design.\n\n## 17. Current Test Coverage (Step 13)\n\nImplemented tests exercising core object lifecycle:\n\n1. `generation.test.ts` – Base tile generation determinism (seed + coords).\n2. `biomes.test.ts` – Deterministic biome assignment; desert palette validation.\n3. `object-generation.test.ts` – Flower density bounds in grass biome; absence in desert & snow biomes.\n4. `object-persistence.test.ts` – Removal excludes object from serialized diff and reload.\n5. `object-collection.test.ts` – Simulated collection: inventory increment, object removal, persistence of absence.\n6. `persistence.test.ts` – Tile diff serialization roundtrip.\n7. `dirty-flush.test.ts` / `metrics.test.ts` – Performance & dirty flush instrumentation sanity.\n\nPending manual QA (Step 14): visual overlap, player movement during collection, multi-flower rapid collection, density tuning.\n\n## 18. Future Crafting Hook\n\nPlanned feature (see [CRAFTING.md](./CRAFTING.md)): Colored sand crafting using exactly one flower + up to 10 Yellow sand blocks producing a one-for-one number of tinted sand blocks (no multiplier). Will introduce:\n* Crafting modal (opened via minimal HUD option) listing available flower counts.\n* Deterministic recipe mapping (red: 50/50 split; others 100% single color; turquoise maps to cyan until a dark variant exists).\n* Atomic transaction: consumes inputs only if outputs fit in inventory; otherwise aborted.\n* Potential object metadata extension if certain flowers later grant special effects.\n\nImplementation deferred until after any additional QA & tuning; recipe data and execution flow defined in `CRAFTING.md`.\n\n## 19. QA & Tuning (Initial Metrics)\n\nPreliminary automated sampling (`density-sample.test.ts`) over 40 chunkX candidates at y=0 produced:\n\n```\nsampled grass chunks: 15\nmean flowers per grass chunk: ~6.87\nmin: 0\nmax: 32\nstd dev: ~10.73\n```\n\nInterpretation:\n* Actual mean significantly below naive expectation (~40–50) because many sampled chunks were small grass islands (high perimeter sand / water reducing grass tile count) and early sample size limited.\n* High variance (clusters up to 32) suggests occasional denser islands (acceptable for visual variety).\n* Some grass chunks had 0 flowers (allowed by stochastic placement; can consider guaranteed minimum later).\n\nNext QA Actions:\n1. Increase sample size (e.g., 200 chunks) to stabilize mean estimate.\n2. Record average grass tile count alongside flower count to compute ratio precisely.\n3. Decide on adjusting `FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR` (currently 140). If target mean closer to 15–20 flowers per typical island, a divisor in the 60–90 range may be appropriate after refined measurement.\n4. Add optional minimum (e.g., ensure at least 1 flower if any grass > threshold).\n\nCurrent Decision: Keep divisor at 140 until larger sample collected; avoid premature tuning.\n\n### Extended Sampling (120 candidates, 37 grass chunks)\n\n```\nsampled grass chunks: 37\nmean flowers per grass chunk: ~6.38\nmean grass tiles per chunk: ~6706.59\nflowers per grass tile ratio: ~0.00095 (≈ 1 / 1052)\nmin flowers: 0\nmax flowers: 32\nstd dev flowers: ~10.32\n```\n\nInterpretation:\n* Actual ratio (~1/1050) is much sparser than target design intent (~1/140) because grass tile heuristic counts entire predominant tile region (includes edge sand misclassification risk) and island generation yields large grass areas but low object probability.\n* To reach a target mean of ~15–20 flowers on these islands, adjust placement probability from 1/140 to roughly 1/450–1/330 (scales ratio up ~2–3x given current observed grass area; conservative starting point).\n* Recommended next tuning: set `FLOWER_DENSITY_DIVISOR` to 330, re-sample; if mean jumps near 20, optionally reduce slightly (e.g., 360–400). Provide guarantee of at least 1 flower on chunks with > 3000 grass tiles.\n\nPlanned Change (deferred until approval): Update constant and add minimum guarantee logic.","../../docs/COLLECTIBLES.md","f988c6c1904fd41f",{"html":334,"metadata":335},"\u003Ch2 id=\"collectible-objects-flowers--future-resources\">Collectible Objects (Flowers &#x26; Future Resources)\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"status\">Status\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In Progress – Steps 1–12 implemented &#x26; tested (types, persistence, generation, rendering, object-first collection, HUD badge, density &#x26; biome tests, collection &#x26; persistence tests).

It should represent some of the core elements of Minecraft, while being much simpler and allowing to \"draw\" pictures with the colored blocks.\n- **Style:** Top-down perspective with tile-based maps and sprite characters, inspired by classic exploration games.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDetailed planning documents can be found in the `/docs` directory.\n\n## Core Development Steps\n\n### 1. Use VSCode, Copilot with GPT-4.1, GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5 to drive the game development\n\nExploring vibe coding capabilities of these models was one of the goals of this project. It has worked quite well at times and not at all at others. In general:\n\n- The more the AI iterated over the xisting code base, the messier it got.\n- At times it was challenging to catch up on the AI created code, because it's just too easy to not review the AI made changes detailed enough.\n\n### 2. Use Copilot to create a game icon\n\n![Source images and prompt](images/app_icon_generation_prompt.png)\n\nCopilot was very successful in creating a Minecraft-like picture based on one of Amelie's photos.\n\n![Result](../apps/amelcraft/assets/manifest/icons/icon-256x256.png)\n\n### 3. Turning it into a PWA\n\nUsing the either of the following two, free online apps to generate icons from a source image and manifest metadata, to turn the web app into a PWA.\n\n- https://pwa-icon-generator.vercel.app/\n- https://realfavicongenerator.net/","../../docs/README.md",[405,406,407],"images/qr-code.svg","images/app_icon_generation_prompt.png","../apps/amelcraft/assets/manifest/icons/icon-256x256.png","c786561aa12281a5",{"html":410,"metadata":411},"\u003Ch1 id=\"birthday-detective-game\">Birthday Detective Game\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>The game can be played by visiting \u003Ca href=\"https://game.amelie.belgar.eu/bd-25/\">https://game.amelie.belgar.eu/bd-25/\u003C/a>, or by scanning this QR code.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/qr-code.svg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;QR Code&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This repository contains a simple top-down game, inspired by Minecraft, being developed for Amelie’s 7th birthday.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"project-details\">Project Details\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Goal:\u003C/strong> Create a fun, exploration-based game playable in a web browser.
